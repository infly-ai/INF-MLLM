## Install
```
conda create -n infmllm python=3.9
conda activate infmllm
conda install pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia

## Model Zoo
Both the multitask and instruction tuning models are now available on Hugging Face!

- [InfMLLM-7B-Chat](https://huggingface.co/mightyzau/InfMLLM_7B_Chat)
- [InfMLLM-13B-Chat]


## Evaluation

We conducted evaluations of the **InfMLLM-7B** multitask model across five VQA (Visual Question Answering) datasets and three visual grounding datasets. Meanwhile, the **InfMLLM-7B-Chat** model, tuned for instruction-following, was assessed on four VQA datasets and six multi-modal benchmarks. For detailed evaluation procedures, please refer to [Evaluation](docs/Evaluation.md).

</p>

With larger size LLM and self-built SFT dataset, **InfMLLM** has achieved better scores on several multi-modal benchmarks. 
**MME**
**InfMLLM-13B-Chat** has achieved 1673.46 points on MME perception score, which was top1 on 2023-12-12. Please refer to MME.
**SEED-Bench**
**InfMLLM-13B-Chat** has achieved 62.3 average score on SEED v1 benchmark, which was top1 on 2023-11-18.

## Demo
Trying **InfMLLM-7B-Chat** is straightforward. We've provided a [demo script](demo.py) to run on the following example image.

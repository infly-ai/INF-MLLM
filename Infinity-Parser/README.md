# Introduction

We develop Infinity-Parser, an end-to-end scanned document parsing model trained with reinforcement learning. By incorporating verifiable rewards based on layout and content, Infinity-Parser maintains the original document's structure and content with high fidelity. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks in cluding OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose vision-language models while preserving the modelâ€™s general multimodal understanding capability.

## Key Features

- LayoutRL Framework: a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly trains models to be layout-aware through verifiable multi-aspect rewards combining edit distance, paragraph accuracy, and reading order preservation.

- Infinity-Doc-400K Dataset: a large-scale dataset of 400K scanned documents that integrates high-quality synthetic data with diverse real-world samples, featuring rich layout variations and comprehensive structural annotations.

- Infinity-Parser Model: a VLM-based parser that achieves new state-of-the-art performance on OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading-order detection benchmarks in both English and Chinese, while maintaining nearly the same general multimodal understanding capability as the base model.

# Quick Start
## Download Model Weights

```shell
git clone https://github.com/infly-ai/INF-MLLM.git
cd Infinity-Parser
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 tools/download_model.py
```

## Vllm Inference

### 
We recommend using the vLLM backend for accelerated inference. 
It supports image and PDF inputs, automatically parses the document content, and exports the results in Markdown format to a specified directory.

Before starting, make sure that **PyTorch** is correctly installed according to the official installation guide at [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/).

```shell
pip install .

parser --model /path/model --input dir/PDF/Image --output output_folders --batch_size 128 --tp 1
```

Adjust the tensor parallelism (tp) value â€” 1, 2, or 4 â€” and the batch size according to the number of GPUs and the available memory.

<details>
  <summary> [The information of result folder] </summary>
The result folder contains the following contents:

```
output_folders/
â”œâ”€â”€ <file_name>/output.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

</details>

### Online Serving

- Launch the vLLM Server

```shell
vllm serve  /path/to/model --tensor-parallel-size=4 --served-model-name=Infinity_Parser
```

- Python Client Example

```python
import os
import re
import sys
import json
from PIL import Image                 
from openai import OpenAI, AsyncOpenAI   
import base64, pathlib

prompt = r'''You are an AI assistant specialized in converting PDF images to Markdown format. Please follow these instructions for the conversion:

        1. Text Processing:
        - Accurately recognize all text content in the PDF image without guessing or inferring.
        - Convert the recognized text into Markdown format.
        - Maintain the original document structure, including headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.

        2. Mathematical Formula Processing:
        - Convert all mathematical formulas to LaTeX format.
        - Enclose inline formulas with \( \). For example: This is an inline formula \( E = mc^2 \)
        - Enclose block formulas with \\[ \\]. For example: \[ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

        3. Table Processing:
        - Convert tables to HTML format.
        - Wrap the entire table with <table> and </table>.

        4. Figure Handling:
        - Ignore figures content in the PDF image. Do not attempt to describe or convert images.

        5. Output Format:
        - Ensure the output Markdown document has a clear structure with appropriate line breaks between elements.
        - For complex layouts, try to maintain the original document's structure and format as closely as possible.

        Please strictly follow these guidelines to ensure accuracy and consistency in the conversion. Your task is to accurately convert the content of the PDF image into Markdown format without adding any extra explanations or comments.

# Visualization

## Comparison Examples
![image](assets/case.jpeg)

# Limitation & Future Work

## Limitations
 - **Layout / BBox**: The current model does not provide layout or bounding box (bbox) information, which limits its ability to support downstream tasks such as structured document reconstruction or reading order prediction.
 - **Charts & Figures**: The model lacks perception and understanding of charts and figures, and therefore cannot perform visual reasoning or structured extraction for graphical elements.
 
## Future Work

We are dedicated to enabling our model to **read like humans**, and we firmly believe that **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** can make this vision possible. We have conducted **preliminary explorations of reinforcement learning (RL) for document parsing** and achieved promising initial results.  In future research, we will continue to deepen our efforts in the following directions:

- **Chart & Figure Understanding**: Extend the modelâ€™s capability to handle chart detection, semantic interpretation, and structured data extraction from graphical elements.

- **General-Purpose Perception**: Move toward a unified **Vision-Language perception model** that integrates detection, image captioning, OCR, layout analysis, and chart understanding into a single framework.

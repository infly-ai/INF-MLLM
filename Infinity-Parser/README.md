# Introduction

We develop Infinity-Parser, an end-to-end scanned document parsing model trained with reinforcement learning. By incorporating verifiable rewards based on layout and content, Infinity-Parser maintains the original document's structure and content with high fidelity. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks in cluding OmniDocBench, olmOCR-Bench, PubTabNet, and FinTabNet show that Infinity-Parser consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a broad range of document types, languages, and structural complexities, substantially outperforming both specialized document parsing systems and general-purpose vision-language models while preserving the model‚Äôs general multimodal understanding capability.

## Key Features

- LayoutRL Framework: a reinforcement learning framework that explicitly trains models to be layout-aware through verifiable multi-aspect rewards combining edit distance, paragraph accuracy, and reading order preservation.

- Infinity-Doc-400K Dataset: a large-scale dataset of 400K scanned documents that integrates high-quality synthetic data with diverse real-world samples, featuring rich layout variations and comprehensive structural annotations.

- Infinity-Parser Model: a VLM-based parser that achieves new state-of-the-art performance on OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading-order detection benchmarks in both English and Chinese, while maintaining nearly the same general multimodal understanding capability as the base model.

# Quick Start
### Download Model Weights

```shell
git clone https://github.com/infly-ai/INF-MLLM.git
cd Infinity-Parser
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 tools/download_model.py
```

### Vllm Inference
We recommend using the vLLM backend for accelerated inference. 
It supports image and PDF inputs, automatically parses the document content, and exports the results in Markdown format to a specified directory.

Before starting, make sure that **PyTorch** is correctly installed according to the official installation guide at [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/).

```shell
pip install .

parser --model /path/model --input dir/PDF/Image --output output_folders --batch_size 128 --tp 1
```

Adjust the tensor parallelism (tp) value ‚Äî 1, 2, or 4 ‚Äî and the batch size according to the number of GPUs and the available memory.

<details>
  <summary>„ÄêThe information of result folder„Äë</summary>
The result folder contains the following contents:

```
output_folders/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <fime_name>/output.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

</details>


### Using Transformers to Inference

<details>
    <summary> Transformers Inference Example </summary>
    
```python
import torch
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

model_path = "infly/Infinity-Parser-7B"
prompt = "Please transform the document‚Äôs contents into Markdown format."

print("Loading model and processor...")
# Default: Load the model on the available device(s)
# model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     model_path, torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
# )

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
    device_map="auto",
)

# Default processor
# processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path)

# Recommended processor
min_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28   # 448 * 448
max_pixels = 2304 * 28 * 28  # 1344 * 1344
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path, min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)

print("Preparing messages for inference...")
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://ofasys-multimodal-wlcb-3-toshanghai.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/wpf272043/keepme/image/receipt.png",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": prompt},
        ],
    }
]

text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
inputs = processor(
    text=[text],
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
inputs = inputs.to("cuda")

print("Generating results...")
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=4096)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)

## Limitation & Future Work

### Limitations
 - **Layout / BBox**: The current model does not provide layout or bounding box (bbox) information, which limits its ability to support downstream tasks such as structured document reconstruction or reading order prediction.
 - **Charts & Figures**: The model lacks perception and understanding of charts and figures, and therefore cannot perform visual reasoning or structured extraction for graphical elements.
 
### Future Work

We are dedicated to enabling our model to **read like humans**, and we firmly believe that **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** can make this vision possible. We have conducted **preliminary explorations of reinforcement learning (RL) for document parsing** and achieved promising initial results.  In future research, we will continue to deepen our efforts in the following directions:

- **Chart & Figure Understanding**: Extend the model‚Äôs capability to handle chart detection, semantic interpretation, and structured data extraction from graphical elements.

- **General-Purpose Perception**: Move toward a unified **Vision-Language perception model** that integrates detection, image captioning, OCR, layout analysis, and chart understanding into a single framework.
